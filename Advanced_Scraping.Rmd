## Law/Ethics

Scraping public websites, even against the terms of service, is probably legal. See hiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp (2019). https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/09/victory-ruling-hiq-v-linkedin-protects-scraping-public-data

But circumventing technical restrictions (passwords, captchas) is probably illegal.

In any case, be nice! 

- add a delay between pages
- only use distributed scraping against rich sites

## Random headers to avoid blocking

\tiny

```
desktop_agents = ['Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.99 Safari/537.36',

def random_headers():
    return {'User-Agent': choice(desktop_agents),'Accept':'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8'}

```

## Download Youtube videos

Downloading Youtube videos can be important for research reproducibility (see Rich's book).

```

```

## Download Youtube metadata

We probably care just as much about the video metadata

```

## Downloading a whole bunch of PDFs

\small

```
def download_cable(i, year, collection, outdir):
    docid = str(i)
    collection = "2694"
    year = "1978"
    docname = outdir + year + "_" + docid + ".pdf"
    url = "http://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid={0}&dt={1}&dl=2"\
          .format(docid, collection)
    req = urllib2.Request(url)
    r = urllib2.urlopen(req)
    if r.readline():
        f = open(docname, 'wb')
        f.write(r.read())
        f.close()
```

## Reverse-engineering API calls

Sometimes you can directly access the raw data that goes into a page's visualization using the "Javascript Console"/network tab.

```
https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/arrest/
```

## OCR and Tesseract

If you scrape image PDFs that you want the text from, you'll need to do optical character recognition to convert the image to text

```
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract
```

## Big scrape

- Q: What if you're scraping 10 million stories and you don't want to start over if something breaks?  
- A: Use queues, databases, and multiple workers

## Newspapers3k

Scraping a bunch of articles from a bunch of sites? This library automatically finds titles, authors, text, etc.

```

```

## Rendering Javascript

Some page elements are dynamically generated and require Javascript to render.

To scrape, we can use a combination of `PhantomJS` (a windowless browser) and `selenium` (a tool for automating browser actions).
